# CRep: reciprocity and community detection in networks
Python implementation of CRep algorithm described in:

- [1] Safdari H., Contisciani M. & De Bacco C. (2021). *Generative model for reciprocity and community detection in networks*, Phys. Rev. Research 3, 023209.  

This is a new probabilistic generative model and efficient algorithm to model reciprocity in directed networks. It assigns latent variables as community memberships to nodes and a reciprocity parameter to the whole network and it formalizes the assumption that a directed interaction is more likely to occur if an individual has already observed an interaction towards her. <br>

## What's included
- `code` : Contains the Python implementation of CRep algorithm, the code for performing the cross-validation procedure and the code for generating benchmark synthetic data with intrinsic community structure and given reciprocity value.
- `data/input` : Contains an example of directed network having an intrinsic community structure and a given reciprocity value, and some example files to initialize the latent variables. They are synthetic data.
- `data/output` : Contains some results to test the code.

## Requirements
The project has been developed using Python 3.9 with the packages contained in *requirements.txt*. We suggest to create a virtual environment with
`python3.9 -m venv --copies CRep`, activate it with `source CRep/bin/activate`, and install all the dependencies by running (inside `CRep` directory):

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Test
You can run tests to reproduce results contained in `data/output` by running (inside `code` directory):  

```bash
python -m unittest test.py   
python -m unittest test_cv.py
```

## Usage
To test the program on the given example file, type:  

```bash
cd code
python main.py
```

It will use the sample network contained in `./data/input`. The adjacency matrix *syn111.dat* represents a directed, weighted network with **N=600** nodes, **K=3** equal-size unmixed communities with an **assortative** structure and reciprocity parameter **eta=0.5**. 

### Parameters
- **-a** : Model configuration to use (CRep, CRepnc, CRep0), *(default='CRep')*.
- **-K** : Number of communities, *(default=3)*.
- **-A** : Input file name of the adjacency matrix, *(default='syn111.dat')*.
- **-f** : Path of the input folder, *(default='../data/input/')*.
- **-e** : Name of the source of the edge, *(default='source')*.
- **-t** : Name of the target of the edge, *(default='target')*.
- **-d** : Flag to force a dense transformation of the adjacency matrix, *(default=False)*.
- **-F** : Flag to choose the convergence method, *(default='log')*.

You can find a list by running (inside `code` directory): 

```bash
python main.py --help
```

## Input format
The network should be stored in a *.dat* file. An example of rows is

`node1 node2 3` <br>
`node1 node3 1`

where the first and second columns are the _source_ and _target_ nodes of the edge, respectively; the third column tells if there is an edge and the weight. In this example the edge node1 --> node2 exists with weight 3, and the edge node1 --> node3 exists with weight 1.

Other configuration settings can be set by modifying the *setting\_\*_.yaml* files: 

- *setting\_syn_data.yaml* : contains the setting to generate synthetic data
- *setting\_CRep.yaml* : contains the setting to run the algorithm CRep
- *setting\_CRepnc.yaml* : contains the setting to run the algorithm CRep without normalization constraints on the membership parameters
- *setting\_CRep0.yaml* : contains the setting to run the algorithm CRep without considering  the reciprocity effect

## Output
The algorithm returns a compressed file inside the `data/output` folder. To load and print the out-going membership matrix:

```bash
import numpy as np 
theta = np.load('theta_Crep.npz')
print(theta['u'])
```

_theta_ contains the two $N\times K$ membership matrices **u** *('u')* and **v** *('v')*, the $1\times K \times K$ (or $1\times K$ if assortative=True) affinity tensor **w** *('w')*, the reciprocity coefficient **$\eta$** *('eta')*, the total number of iterations *('max_it')*, the value of the maximum pseudo log-likelihood *('maxPSL')* and the nodes of the network *('nodes')*.
